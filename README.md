# .emacs.d
This is my custom made emacs configuration based on Vim-like keybindings

## Why?
Many people seek the modularity of Vim + the extensibility of emacs without the
complexity of spacemacs or other gigantic emacs configurations. So I personally
created a much simpler, and easier to follow, set of config files.
